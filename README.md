__Learning Outcomes:__

This assignment will help you practice sorting and recursion.

__Description:__

Complete the methods to write a Merge Sort for our LinkedList class.  The LinkedList we will be using is the same file we did way back in Module 5 with some additional code used for the test cases.  Download the following files and create a project.  Then, follow the comments in the LinkedList.h file and complete the methods to code a mergeSort().

* [LinkedList.h](https://weber.instructure.com/courses/564343/files/107306270/download?wrap=1)
* [MergeSortTester.cpp](https://weber.instructure.com/courses/564343/files/107306267/download?wrap=1)

Make sure it passes all the tests cases.  Then submit the LinkedList.h file.

__Submission:__

* Submit the LinkedList.h file or provide a URL to your repl file.
* Take a screenshot of the program run showing the output of the test cases and submit that as well.
